        "description": "iPhone 14 Pro. The list of novelties this year includes the notch morphing into a pill, the introduction of an Always-On display, and an all-new primary camera - and while you can get all of that on the 14 Pro, the extra screen estate and longevity coupled with the Max's 'ultimate' status mean it has a market niche of its own.The Face ID notch that's been with us since the iPhone X was nobody's favorite, and perhaps its reincarnation as a pill is a step towards its eventual removal. But not before turning the eyesore into a feature - the pill is a Dynamic Island of notifications, blurring the line between hardware and software.In a similar vein is the Always-On display - a software feature only made possible now in Apple's world thanks to LTPO displays being able to ramp down to 1Hz refresh rate.A massive increase in brightness is also among the key developments this year, this one solely in the hardware department.Late to yet another party, Apple finally joins virtually ever other manufacturer and introduces a camera with a Quad Bayer type sensor - the specs on the 48MP main unit don't read like any other, so apparently, it's an exclusive design. The telephoto remains unchanged, but the ultra-wide has gotten a sensor size upgrade, while the front-facing one now features autofocus (and even OIS).On the hardware front, there's the mandatory chipset update, of course, and little else worth mentioning. Well, there's the blanked-out SIM card slot. Crash detection and emergency sort-of satellite connectivity are also on the list of new features combining software and hardware.iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro do not include a power adapter or Ear Pods.

The list of novelties this year includes the notch morphing into a pill, the introduction of an Always-On display, and an all-new primary camera - and while you can get all of that on the 14 Pro, the extra screen estate and longevity coupled with the Max's 'ultimate' status mean it has a market niche of its own.The Face ID notch that's been with us since the iPhone X was nobody's favorite, and perhaps its reincarnation as a pill is a step towards its eventual removal. But not before turning the eyesore into a feature - the pill is a Dynamic Island of notifications, blurring the line between hardware and software.In a similar vein is the Always-On display - a software feature only made possible now in Apple's world thanks to LTPO displays being able to ramp down to 1Hz refresh rate.A massive increase in brightness is also among the key developments this year, this one solely in the hardware department.Late to yet another party, Apple finally joins virtually ever other manufacturer and introduces a camera with a Quad Bayer type sensor - the specs on the 48MP main unit don't read like any other, so apparently, it's an exclusive design. The telephoto remains unchanged, but the ultra-wide has gotten a sensor size upgrade, while the front-facing one now features autofocus (and even OIS).On the hardware front, there's the mandatory chipset update, of course, and little else worth mentioning.
